## What is a Binary Tree?

    A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each
    node has at most two children,
    referred to as the left child and the right child.
    It is used to represent hierarchical structures
    like family trees, file systems, and more.

## Binary Tree vs. Binary Search Tree

    A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree
    where the left subtree contains nodes with values less than
    the root node,
    and the right subtree contains nodes with
    values greater than the root node.
    This property allows for efficient
    searching and sorting operations.

## Time Complexity vs. Linked Lists

    Compared to linked lists, binary trees can offer significant
    improvements in time complexity for various operations.
    Searching, insertion, and deletion in a well-balanced binary
    tree can have a time complexity of O(log N), which is much
    more efficient than linear time complexity (O(N))
    for linked lists.

## Binary Tree Terminology

    - **Depth**: The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to that node.

    - **Height**: The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node. It represents the depth of the deepest node.

    - **Size**: The size of a binary tree is the total number of nodes it contains.

## Binary Tree Traversal Methods

    There are several ways to traverse a binary tree:

    1. **Inorder Traversal**: Visit the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
    2. **Preorder Traversal**: Visit the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
    3. **Postorder Traversal**: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.
    4. **Level Order Traversal**: Visit nodes level by level, starting from the root.

## Types of Binary Trees

    - **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all levels are completely filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.
    - **Full Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children. In other words, each node is either a leaf or has two child nodes.

    - **Perfect Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two child nodes, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

    - **Balanced Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which the depth of the left and right subtrees of every node differs by at most one.
